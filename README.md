# 🐦 Jrookie 
>💡 Jrookie = Java + rookie

Jrookie is a simple and easy used personal blog system which is made by [spring-boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

And Jrookie is also a practice project of myself for java programming, So in order to learn framework of [spring-boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), 
I will design some parts of the project to be more complicated which is not necessary in fact.

# Install and Getting start

If you want to try out latest version, Jrookie can be easily built with the [maven wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper).
You also need JDK 1.8.

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

Then you can click [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to open a browser and see the index.
